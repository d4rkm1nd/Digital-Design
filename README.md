# Digital-Design
The goal is to have a app where you can edit the design of a t-shirt. 
Originally i was thinking that it would be user-based app, and each user can upload his designs. 
Firstly, i wanted to add the basic functionality to design the t-shirt:
- you can add images from gallery;
- you can move them.
I wanted to make an eraser using the Porter-Duff clear mode,
but i got stuck as i don't know how to transfer the bitmap from the imported image form the Gallery
in the createObjectLayout.java View file into the createObject.java activity file.
This is where i got stuck.
